# Credbull Coding Exercise

## Objective 
- **Demonstrate** your problem solving and developer skills.     
- Have a **conversation** with one of the Credbull Engineers about your solution, thought processes, road bumps, etc.
- Time-box the exercise to 2-3 hours.  We respect your free time!  

## Coding Exercise
- [ ] Create a Solidity contract that accepts and tracks deposits and allows the depositor to withdraw their deposited amount.  
- [ ] Create an App in Typescript and ether.js (or similar) that can interact with your contract.
- [ ] Implement **only 1-2 features** from below.  Or come up with your own! 
    - Min transfer amount - only accept deposits above a certain minimum amount
    - Max total amount - only accept transfers into a contract when the total contract value is below the maximum
    - Yield - on withdrawal, depositors receive their deposit plus a proportional amount of any "excess" balance in the contract  
    - Whitelist - only allow transfers from whitelisted addresses
    - Fees - keep 1% of deposits as fees.


## Implementation Ideas
Develop the solution however you like.  Credbull have used the following, they may also help you!
* Credbull uses [OpenZepplein's ERC4626](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol) implementation of the [erc-4626 Vault Standard](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-4626/) as the basis for our contracts.  
* [scaffold-eth-2](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2) is great for rapid prototyping.  This repo uses foundry, but there's a hardhat version as well.

## Sample Email to Candidate

Thank you for applying to Credbull!

The next steps in the interview process are a Coding Exercise and Technical interview.

1. Please see the Coding Exercise instructions here: https://github.com/credbull/credbull-interview/blob/main/EXERCISE.md
1. Once you complete the Coding Exercise, email your solution (e.g. github repo) to ian@credbull.io
1. During the Technical interview, please walk through your solution with a Credbull Engineer.  Together you will discuss the problem,
your decisions and solution.  This is similar to your daily work if you join us!

Please let us know if you have any questions.  Thank you!
